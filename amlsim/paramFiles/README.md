### degree.csv
This CSV file has three columns with header names: `Count`, `In-degree` and `Out-degree`.
Each CSV row indicates how many account vertices with certain in(out)-degrees should be generated.

Here is an example of degree.csv.
```
Count,In-degree,Out-degree
0,2,2
1,1,1
2,2,2
```
From this parameter file, the transaction graph generator generates a directed graph with five vertices (accounts) and five edges.
Two of five vertices has no outgoing edges and two of five vertices has no incoming edges (these two vertices might be same).
